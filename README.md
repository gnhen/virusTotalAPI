I have created a program that will take your file and run it against VirusTotal using your API.
You can either use the provided EXE file and run in the command line USING "python virustotal-a.exe /path/to/file.file"
Or you can use the Installer, which allows you to right click a file and select "Scan with VirusTotal"

Check Releases for files


FOR INSTALLER

Once installed, make sure to add your API key in the %appdata% folder
